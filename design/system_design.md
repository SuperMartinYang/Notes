# System Design

## Step 1: Understand overall system / application
* clarify 

## Step 2: Understand system funcitonal requirements
* what functions should be supported.

## Step 3: Understand system non-functional requirements
* availability, consistency, Partition tolerance

## Step 4: Evaluate workload
* assumption of data

## Step 5: Brain storm system
* S.N.A.K.E
    * S -> Scenario: usecase
    * N -> Necessity: assumptions / constraints
    * A -> Application: architecture
    * K -> Kilobit: data model, store, query
    * E -> Evolve: high ACP

## Step 6: Scale out
